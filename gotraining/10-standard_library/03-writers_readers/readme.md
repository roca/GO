## Writers/Readers - Standard Library

The ability to stream and pass data around is incredibility important. Data is constantly coming at our programs whether over a socket, file, device, etc. Many times this data needs to just be moved from one stream. Sometimes it needs to be encrypted, hashed or stored for safe keeping. The Writer and Reader interfaces may be the most heavily used and supported interfaces in both the standard library and the community.

## Notes

* The standard library provides all the infrastructure we need to stream and work with data.
* If we implement the Reader and Writer interfaces in our own types, we get this functionality for free.
* Implementing interfaces to existing functionality saves us from both development time and bugs.
