## Logging - Standard Library

Logging is an important part of every program. Logs are our eyes and history to what is happening inside the program as it runs. The standard library provides the log package to support the basic features of logging and the ability for you to extend and customize logging to fit your needs.

## Notes

* Support for logging is already built into the standard library.
* The log package can be easily extended to meet your logging needs.
