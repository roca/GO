## HTTP - API's

The Go standard library provides all the critical building blocks for producing web sites and APIs.

## Notes

* net/http provides an HTTP/1.1 compliant protocol implementation.
* There is support for SSL/TLS.
* Adding routing and middleware to your applications requires only a few simple patterns.

## Advanced Code Review

[Web API](api)  
Sample code that provides best practices for building a RESTful API in Go. It leverages the standard library except for the router where a package named [httptreemux](https://github.com/dimfeld/httptreemux) is used. This router provides some nice conveniences such as handling verbs and access to parameters.
