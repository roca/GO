## Special Features Of Go

I may be biased, but I truly believe Go is an amazing language. It balances the efficiency of a lower level systems language with the most important features of a high-level modern language. This creates a programming environment that allows you to be incredibly productive, performant and fully in control; in Go you can write less code and do so much more. Here are some other special features about the language:

#### * Comes with a robust standard library.

#### * Works on a multitude of platforms.

#### * Code is statically compiled so deployment is trivial.

#### * The documentation is exemplary and complete, yet concise.

#### * Comes with a tool to test, profile and benchmark your code.

#### * Can interact with C libraries via cgo.
