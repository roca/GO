## Variables - Language Syntax

Variables are at the heart of the language and provide the ability to read from and write to memory. In Go, access to memory is type safe. This means the compiler takes type seriously and will not allow us to use variables outside the scope of how they are declared.

## Notes

* When variables are being declared to their zero value, use the keyword var.
* When variables are being declared and initialized, use the short variable declaration operator.
* Escape analysis is used to determine when a value escapes to the heap.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 

**Part A:** Declare three variables that are initialized to their zero value and three declared with a literal value. Declare variables of type string, int and bool. Display the values of those variables.

**Part B:** Declare a new variable of type float32 and initialize the variable by converting the literal value of Pi (3.14).
