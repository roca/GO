## Using Pointers

When creating a new type, try to answer this question before declaring methods. Does adding or removing something from a value of this type need to create a new value or mutate the existing one. If the answer is create a new value, then use value receivers, else use pointer receivers; and be consistent. This also applies to how values of this type should be passed to other parts of your program. Either, always use a value or a pointer, don’t mix it up. There are few exceptions to the rule.

## Notes

* The nature of the type should determine how it is passed.
* Types can implement primitive and non-primitive data qualities.
* Don't declare structs with a duality of nature.
* In general, don’t pass built-in type values with a pointer.
* In general, don’t pass reference type values with a pointer unless you are implementing unmarshal type of functionality.
* In general, pass struct type values with a pointer unless the struct type has been implemented to behave like a primitive data value.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Declare a struct type named Point with two fields, X and Y of type float64. Implement a factory function for this type and a method
that accept a value of this type and calculates the distance between the two points. What is the nature of this type?
