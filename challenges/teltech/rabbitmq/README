The Challenge
Using the language of your choice, you'll need to do the following.

Connect to a RabbitMQ server
User = challenge
Pass = k64sMKmWEyg85VZs
Host = rabbitmq-1.8696e293-bmoyles0117.node.tutum.io
Port = 5672
Virtual Host Is Blank / Default
Declare a queue on Rabbit server using your github login as the queue name
NOTE: Define the "auto-delete" param on the queue as true so that you do not get stale messages on reconnect
Bind the queue to the "amq.topic" exchange
Consume messages produced on your queue with the topic of "formula"
Messages are JSON encoded and will contain the following
uuid = A unique ID to produce a response with the solution embedded
contestant_uuid = Your dynamic token at the top of the page when logged in to Github
formula = A simple math formula for you to parse and solve
solution = A null value that should be replaced with the solution
Produce a message back onto the queue
Exchange = amq.topic
Topic = formula_solution
Body = The original message with the solution field populated
