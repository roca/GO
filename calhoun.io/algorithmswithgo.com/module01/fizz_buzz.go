// FizzBuzz will print out all of the numbers
// from 1 to N replacing any divisible by 3
// with "Fizz", and divisible by 5 with "Buzz",
// and any divisible by both with "Fizz Buzz".
//
// Note: The test for this is a little
// complicated so that you can just use the
// `fmt` package and print to standard out.
// I wouldn't normally recommend this, but did
// it here to make life easier for beginners.
