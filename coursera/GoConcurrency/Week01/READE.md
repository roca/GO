Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. This observation is nolonger valid because of the phyiscal limitations of packing more and more transistors onto a single board.

- Increasing transistor density leads to increased power consumption. High power leads to high temperature. Creative ways of keep the transitor cool is becoming increasingly difficult

-  Also has more and more transistor are pack close togther
