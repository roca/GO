= Service Discovery with Consul

== Start and Run Consul

We will be using Docker Compose to start and run Consul together with the Gin Web example.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

== Exploring the HTTP API

Import the supplied Postman JSON collection file and perform the HTTP calls.

== Healtch Checks

For the example microservice we will call the `/ping` endpoints periodically to check their health.
When everythin is running OK, stop one of the **gin-web** container. One of the health checks will
become unhealthy. The start again, and the service should become healthy again.
