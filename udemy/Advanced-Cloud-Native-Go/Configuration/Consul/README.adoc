= Service Configuration with Consul

== Start and Run Consul

We will be using Docker Compose to start and run Consul.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

== Explore the CLI and Web UI

Open a browser with the following URL and browse to the KV section: http://localhost:8500/

You can also use the `consul` CLI to create, read, update and delete K/V pairs.

```bash
$ consul kv get example/key
$ consul kv put example/key "Hello World."

$ consul kv put foo bar
$ consul kv get foo

$ consul kv put foo zip
$ consul kv get foo

$ consul kv delete foo
$ consul kv delete example/key
```

== Exploring the HTTP API

Import the supplied Postman JSON collection file and perform the HTTP calls.
