Golang was designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike,
 and Ken Thompson. Ken called Rob on 519-555-7765 which was redirected to +44 22 777 555.
Jesse sent an email to jc.@gmail.com which he found on the website http://jcharistech.com.
Golang was publicly announced in November 2009 and version 1.0 was released in March 2012.
Go is widely used in production at Google USA and in many other organizations and open-source projects.
In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts were released by type designers Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes specifically for use by the Go project. Go is a humanist sans-serif which resembles Lucida Grande and Go Mono is monospaced. Each of the fonts adhere to the WGL4 character set and were designed to be legible with a large x-height and distinct letterforms. Both Go and Go Mono adhere to the DIN 1450 standard by having a slashed zero, lowercase l with a tail, and an uppercase I with serifs.
